APIs:

- Application Programming Interfaces
- A set of commands, functions, protocols and objects that we can use to create software 
or interact with an external system 
- Websites will allow you to access some information
- jQuery is an API 
- Focusing on APIs that allow me to interact with an external server. 

API Endpoints, Paths and Parameters:

- Endpoints
    - An endpoint is different for every API and is a URL
    - If you post the URL into your browser, the browser will make a GET request to the server and the server will
    respond with a piece of data

- Paths and Parameters
    - Some APIs will allow you to customise what kind of data you would like to receive 
    - Will have to edit the URL and have a specific path to display the data 
    - Servers may not have planned out exactly what kind of request they will receive so they have to be flexible
    - Parameters go at the end of a URL with (?contains=[query])
    - First query has a ? in front of it and every query afterwards has an & symbol 
    - Can narrow down using paths and parameters in order to get the specific kind of data we want
