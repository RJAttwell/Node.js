Unix Command Line Notes:

- Command Line:
    - Kernal: Actual program that interfaces with hardware. Core of OS.
    - Shell: User interface that allows user to interact with kernal 
    - Two different shells: GUI (Graphic User Interface) and Command Line Interface
    - Command Line is an alternative way to interact with the kernal

    - Bash shell (Bourne Again Shell)
    - Why use command line? Speed and control. Deeper access

- Techniques and Directory Navigation:
    - ls = Prints a list of the directories inside a certain folder/location
    - cd = change directory. Ex: cd Doc(uments) (Can press tab the autofill the rest of the word).
    - Can go through entire path at the same time to get to the location you want Ex: cd/Documents/Learn/JavaScript 

    - Can use last command you typed again by pressing up arrow
    - Can use cd .. takes us back a level Ex: Go from /JavaScript to /Learn folder via cd ..
    - Holding alt allows you to move your cursor to any point in a command
    - CTRL + A = Takes you to start of command
    - CTRL + E = Takes you to end of command
    - pwd shows what folder you're in and the entire path (print working directory)


- Creating, Opening and Removing Files:
    - mkdir [Name] = Creates a new folder
    - touch [Name].[extension] = Creates a new file 
    - start [File Name] = Opens file 
    - start [application] [File Name] = Opens file in a certain application Ex: start Atom text.txt 
    
    - rm [File name] = Removes file 
    - rm * = Deletes all files inside a directory 
    - rm -r [DirectoryName/]
    - -rf - Does not ask for confirmation

- Node Notes:
    - Framework which allows us to use JavaScript to create a back-end
    - Node.js allows us to use Javascript to interact directly with hardware of PC.
    - Editors like Atom are based on Node.js.

    - Can use node to run a file using "node [filename.extension]"
    
    - INSTALL NODE:
        - npm init
        - To agree to all default values, use 'npm init -y'

    - Node REPL (Read Evaluation Print Loops) - Can run certain chunks of code 
    - To access, just write node and press enter 
    - REPL works basically the same as chrome console
    - Can enter start of a command and press tab to see a list of commands 

    - To exit the REPL, either type ".exit" or press CTRL + C twice
    - To clear console, use "clear" 

    - Native Node Modules:
        - Libraries of code built into node
